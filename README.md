Comprehensive Database Management for Sonic Hub Studios
This project focuses on developing a robust database system for Sonic Hub Studios, a leading music company, to optimize data management across its diverse operations. By implementing polyglot persistence, we combined structured and unstructured data management through both RDBMS (SQL Server) and NoSQL (MongoDB) solutions. This approach ensures efficient handling of music track catalogues, client interactions, and audience feedback, enabling Sonic Hub to drive growth and enhance user engagement.

Project Structure
Database Files:
RDBMS (SQL Server): Stores structured data such as client details, music tracks, reservations, and royalties.
NoSQL (MongoDB): Manages unstructured data, including engagement metrics and feedback from social media platforms.
Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): Visual representation of entities and relationships in the RDBMS, providing an organized database design.
Pseudocode for MongoDB Operations: Steps for creating and managing collections in MongoDB for engagement and feedback data.
README.md: Overview of the project, structure, and setup instructions.

Project Goals
Polyglot Persistence Implementation: Leverage RDBMS for transactional and structured data management, and NoSQL for flexible data modeling to capture dynamic engagement data.
Integrated Data Analysis: Conduct a combined analysis on engagement and revenue data, enabling a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing Sonic Hub's performance.
Hypothesis Testing: Validate the relationship between audience engagement metrics and revenue through regression analysis, helping Sonic Hub make data-driven decisions.

Getting Started
To run this project, ensure that both SQL Server and MongoDB are set up. Required Python libraries include pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and visualization. You can install these via:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

This system offers Sonic Hub Studios an innovative solution for managing its data, supporting strategic decisions and enhancing client satisfaction through personalized music experiences.
